# MP3-Information-Manager

MP3 Information Manager (MP3 IM) is an application designed to make managing MP3 file information easy.

Sometimes you want to edit the ID3v2 information of a lot of MP3 files, but it would take far too long to manually edit them.
While they can work in some situations, automated scripts usually can't figure out things like song/artist name on their own.
This application gives you an easy to use UI which allows you to edit those values. 

## Maven Jar Packaging
To package the project into a jar on your own, open it in your IDE, and enter the following command in maven:
